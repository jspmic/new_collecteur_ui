<img title="Soft" alt="Logo of the app" src="./assets/icon/drawer2.png">
This small app reads from the <a href="https://github.com/jspmic/rest-api">REST API</a> and displays the stored entities as a Datatable.

# Features
- Displays all entities at a certain `date` in either `Transfert` or `Livraison`(refer to the documentation of the API)
- Stores the collected information in an excel file

# Issues
If you're one of the few people who are using it, feel free to open an issue when a problem is encountered.
Here are some guidelines to be respected when writing issues:
- Write the issue in either French or English
- Make sure to write the exact time(dd/mm/YY HH:mm) when the problem occured
- Be respectful

# Final Thought
This app, though small, is one of the demonstrations of how Flutter is great for making cross-platform apps.
